4 week Python course taken at Coding Dojo
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Part 1: Python + Python OOP
        Installation
        Fundamentals:
            Spend 2 days learning syntax. Syntax simply means the vocabulary of the language.
            Practice the fundamentals of programming that you've been using in your morning algorithms.
        Object Oriented Programming:
            Learn OOP, a style of organizing your code that is prevalent in web development.
            Don't underestimate how important it is to develop a solid understanding of OOP, which is a pivotal skill. This is why you spend the rest of your time at the bootcamp building on your understanding.
            Frameworks like Django, Rails, Angular, and iOS are built using an object oriented design pattern.
    Part 2: Flask + MySQL
        Intro to Flask:
            Learn how to make a web server using the Flask framework. You'll create web pages that can accept data sent from a client and return a response. This quick intro will take about 2 days.
        MySQL:
            Spend 2 days learning about MySQL, a commonly used relational database.
            Learn to create visual representations of your database.
            Formulate SQL queries using database creation and management software.
        Flask + MySQL:
            Extend your use of Flask to include data persistence using a database as storage.
            Challenge yourself to complete The Wall, an assignment that brings together all the skills and tools you've learned so far.
            Spend two days completing this section.
    Part 3: Django + Belt
        Django:
            The framework you've all been waiting for!
            You will learn and use code modularization to organize your code according to the purpose it serves.
            Learn to build a project in Django.
            Move on to Django. You'll spend more time with Django than any other Python section. Spend the next 6 days learning this powerful framework.
            Learn to store data in a SQLite database.
            Learn to use an object relational mapping (ORM) to communicate with your database.
    Deployment:
        Learn to move your code (previously hosted on your computer) to the web so everyone can see the product of your hard work!
    Belt Exam:
        On Friday of week 3, you'll be ready to take your first full-stack belt exam!
        Your instructor will give you more details as the date approaches.
        Try not to worry about this for now. The exam is low-pressure and can be retaken.
        The exam is open-web â€“ meaning you have all of your previous code and the entire internet at your disposal!
    Part 4: Belt Retake + Projects
        Retake your belt exam if needed
        Do a project:
            After passing your belt exam, you're ready to do a project!
            Your project is your motivation to earn your belt. Complete your belt quickly in order to spend as much time as possible working on a fun project. Ask your instructor for project ideas if you need help.
            Create anything you want using your new skills. The sky's the limit!
